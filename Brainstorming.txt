Animosity - an individual resource players start with. Does nothing to you, but when you betray someone, you give them one of your animosity, which they can use for something.
Player roles - maybe hidden but probably not?
Different roles start with different sets of 'workers' - cards
* The pickpocket
* The snitch
* The white-collar criminal
* The muscle
* the innocent
* the hacker
* the mobster
* the escapist

Race to 100 victory points - each point is a 'percentage' of an escape
  Follow up - maybe 'points' aren't for players but for escape methods? Dig a tunnel to advance the dig 'points' and get some stake in it.
  Top players with stakes in certain methods get to escape, but they have one final prisoner's dilemma to take.
  AA: Both escape and win
  AB: B wins
  BB: Neither escape and they lose escape progress
